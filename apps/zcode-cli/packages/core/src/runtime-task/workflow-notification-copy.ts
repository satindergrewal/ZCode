 * not stopped for it (or the model would think the whole workflow awaits and drop everything).
 *
 * The structured half uses XML-ish sections (same family as `<task-notification>`, fields locatable by human and model);
 * the prose half carries the next step and boundaries. **No re-sends, no nagging**: the dropped-question fallback is a snapshot query, not a retry.
